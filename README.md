# SNN

This repository contains 3 scripts useful to build 2 different SNN models.

SCH_SNN.py builds a synfire chain network with AdEx neurons;  <br />
Ring_SNN.py builds a ring attractor model with the same neural unit;  <br />
And lastly SNN_plotting.py contains all the code used for plotting.

Codes used in: Hyseni, Fjola, Nicolas P. Rougier, and Arthur Leblois. "Comparative study of synfire chain and ring attractor model for timing in the premotor nucleus in male Zebra Finches."
